# Blue-modules
Modules (ready-mades) for use in Blue.

These Blue Modules are Blue Instruments. They can be imported in the Orchestra by right-clicking and choosing 'Import'.
The Instrument normally contains code and UDOs, that should be copied along with the BSB GUI in the Instument you are working on.

There some final adjustments in your code are probably needed to fully integrate the Module into your Blue Instrument.
