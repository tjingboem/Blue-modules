# Blue-modules
Modules (ready-mades) for use in Blue

These Blue Modules are Blue Instruments. They can be imported in the Orchestra by right-clicking and choosing 'Import'.
The Instrument normally contains code and UDOs, that should be copied along with the BSB GUI in the Instument you are working on.
