# Blue-modules
Modules (ready-mades) for use in Blue.

These Blue Modules are Blue Instruments.
Most of these Module Instruments consists of code and UDOs and the BSB GUI. They should be imported in the Orchestra by right-clicking and choosing 'Import'. These Modules (instruments really) have the suffix .binstr. From there, the BSB, code and UDO's should be copied to the Instrument you are working on.

Some minor and final adjustments in the code of your Instrument are probably needed to fully integrate the Module into your Blue Instrument.
