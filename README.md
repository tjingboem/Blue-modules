# Blue-modules
Modules (nearly ready-mades) for use in Blue (https://blue.kunstmusik.com/), aimed to be as 'plug-and-play' as possible.

These Blue Modules are exported Blue Instruments.
Most of these Module Instruments are made of: code, UDOs and a BSB GUI. They are to be imported in the Orchestra by right-clicking on the TimeLine canvas and choosing 'Import'. The Modules (instruments really) have the suffix .binstr. From there, the BSB, code and UDO's should be copied to the Instrument you are working on.

Final adjustments in the code of your Instrument are needed to fully integrate the Module into your Blue Instrument. That is why i call them 'Nearly Ready Mades'.
I found that, when designing Instruments in Blue, it saves time to not to have to invent the wheel every time for every instrument, but just drop one of these Modules in your own Instrument and go from there.

The Blue Modules can be recognized by their descriptive header, done in Italics.
